Queries on sum of odd number digit sums of all the factors of a number
Given Q queries. Each query contain a positive integer n. The task is to output the sum of sum of odd number digit contained in all the divisors of n.

Examples :
Input : Q = 2, n1 = 10, n2 = 36
Output : 7 18
For Query1,
Divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, 10.
Sum of odd digits in 1 is 1, in 2 is 0, in 5 is 5, in 10 is 1.
So, sum became 7.

For Query 2,
Divisors of 36 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36.
Sum of odd digits in 1 is 1, in 2 is 0, in 3 is 3, in 4 is 0,
in 6 is 0, in 9 is 9, in 12 is 1, in 18 is 1, in 36 is 3.
So, sum became 18.
